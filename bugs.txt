Course.cpp:

- The enrollStudent() function and dropStudent() functions in Course.cpp were always returning false, without considerating whether
the enrolled student count would be greater than the enrollment capacity. Added a check to see if 
enrolledStudentCount < enrollmentCapacity and if true, then returns true after incrementing enrolledStudentCount.

- The dropStudent() function does not check whether the enrolledStudentCount is already at 0. It always returns false no matter what,
    so aded an if statement to check if enrolledStudentCount > 0 to fix this issue. 

- CppLint warning: warning: narrowing conversion from 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') to signed type 'streamsize' (aka 'long') is implementation-defined [bugprone-narrowing-conversions]
    Fixed this issue by converting size_t to std::streamsize by casting.
