Course.cpp:
    - The enrollStudent() function and dropStudent() functions in Course.cpp were always returning false, without considerating whether
the enrolled student count would be greater than the enrollment capacity. Added a check to see if 
enrolledStudentCount < enrollmentCapacity and if true, then returns true after incrementing enrolledStudentCount.
    - The dropStudent() function does not check whether the enrolledStudentCount is already at 0. It always returns false no matter what,
    so aded an if statement to check if enrolledStudentCount > 0 to fix this issue.
