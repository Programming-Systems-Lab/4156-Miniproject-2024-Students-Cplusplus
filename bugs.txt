Course.cpp:
    - The enrollStudent() function and dropStudent() functions in Course.cpp were always returning false, without considerating whether
the enrolled student count would be greater than the enrollment capacity. 
    - The dropStudent() function does not check whether the enrolledStudentCount is already at 0.
