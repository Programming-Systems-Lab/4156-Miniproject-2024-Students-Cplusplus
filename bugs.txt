Course.cpp:

- The enrollStudent() function and dropStudent() functions in Course.cpp were always returning false, without considerating whether
the enrolled student count would be greater than the enrollment capacity. Added a check to see if 
enrolledStudentCount < enrollmentCapacity and if true, then returns true after incrementing enrolledStudentCount.

- The dropStudent() function does not check whether the enrolledStudentCount is already at 0. It always returns false no matter what,
    so aded an if statement to check if enrolledStudentCount > 0 to fix this issue. 

- warning: warning: narrowing conversion from 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') to signed type 'streamsize' (aka 'long') is implementation-defined [bugprone-narrowing-conversions]
    Fixed this issue by converting size_t to std::streamsize by casting.


Department.cpp:
- The getDepartmentChair() function was not functioning properly; it was simply returning the string "departmentChair", rather than
    the actual department chair's name. Fixed by returning the variable departmentChair.

- The dropPersonFromMajor() function did not have a check to see if the number of majors are greater than 0 before subtracting 1 from
    the variable numberOfMajors. Added a conditional to check for this to be true before the subtraction occured. 

- warning: narrowing conversion from 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') to signed type 'streamsize' (aka 'long') is implementation-defined [bugprone-narrowing-conversions]
  Lines 112, 116, 127, 136, 141, 151
   Fixed by converting size_t to std::streamsize.

MyFileDatabase.cpp:
- warning: narrowing conversion from 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long') to signed type 'streamsize' (aka 'long') is implementation-defined [bugprone-narrowing-conversions]
   Lines 49, 68
    Fixed by converting size_t to std::streamsize.

- Added missing return statement for returning departmentMapping for deserialize function.
