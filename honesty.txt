I, Richard Cruz-Silva (rsc2174)>, have read and understood the following:

1. CS department's Policies and Procedures on Academic Honesty
2. The Course Specific Academic Honesty Policies
3. The assignment specs outlining the consequences of not submitting this
   pledge and other aspects of the policy  

I affirm that I will abide by all the policies stated in the relevant materials
from above. I understand that the relevant policies apply to: individual
assignments, group projects, and individual examinations.

I also affirm that I understand that all course materials, with the exception of
the individual/group project, are subject to the appropriate copyrights and thus
will not post them on any public forum or publicly hosted repository, this

I also affirm that I will be 100% honest when evaluating the performance of
myself and my teammates when prompted by an assignment or member of the

for the benefit of myself or others enrolled in the course presently or possibly
in the future.
